## Branch naming (use these exact branch names for new work)
When starting work, create one of these branches (pick the member branch you need):

- `feature/ankit`
- `feature/sonam`
- `feature/utkarsh`

Use the appropriate branch for your work and create new commits on top of it. When a new distinct task requires separation later, create a descriptive branch off the member branch (team decision).

---

## Workflow (simple, for day-one)
1. Create an Issue describing the task and assign it to the appropriate person.  
2. Ensure `dev` is up to date:
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
